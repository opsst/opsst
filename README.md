## Pleasure to meet you ðŸ‘‹

Originally, I was interested in the medical and computer science fields, but now I'm just getting started with web and application development. I'm looking for employment where I can gain some valuable experience. Interested in learning new things and appreciating hard effort. I've worked as a project manager in the biological field since I was 13 and in the computer field since I was 20, so I'm searching for new opportunities to collaborate. Now I'm studying software engineering, but I'm also interested in the fields of machine learning and data science.
